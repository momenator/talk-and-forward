The project was created so that students from all disciplines can apply their theoretical knowledge to contribute to sustainable campus development. Plant a Seed has successfully brought together more than 100 students as an interdisciplinary sustainability education project.\nThe group operates 9 gardens in Munich and 10 in Freising, and already in the summer, the first potatoes, tomatoes, beans, and similar crops are growing in the raised beds in front of the Munich Audimax. The interdisciplinary project is supported by the TUM Sustainability Office as well as by teachers and researchers from various departments and offers ample material for final and project work for students from all disciplines.\nThe members' enthusiasm for sustainable topics has created a wave of action, which is reflected in the dynamic and rapidly growing team. The initiative is led by the student representation and is designed as a participatory initiative where teaching, research, and active dialogue go hand in hand with central issues of our society."

All members work on the question of how the energy transition can promote sustainable development of communities in Africa. The Energy-Water-Food concepts exclusively use renewable energy sources to provide drinking water and food locally and sustainably.\nThe association's approach is based on a three-phase model: conceptualizing a sustainable business model and dimensioning infrastructure, fundraising, on-site installation by students, and workshops for project handover to communities. The sustainability of projects can only be ensured through the participation of the local population, so the association offers self-developed training for communities and supports the operation of the system on technical and social levels.\nCurrently, TU eMpower Africa e.V. is active in several African countries: In Rwanda through solar-powered irrigation, sustainable agriculture, and local partnerships; in Zimbabwe through solar energy, sustainable farming, and entrepreneurship; and in Northern Ghana, where the project strengthens the Namiyela community with solar-powered irrigation, sustainable farming, and women-led development.
